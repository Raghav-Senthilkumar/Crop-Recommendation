Crop Recommendation System

Overview

This project is a Crop Recommendation System that utilizes machine learning to suggest the most suitable crops for cultivation based on various environmental and soil parameters. The system takes input features such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to predict the best crop that can be grown under given conditions.

The model is trained using a dataset containing different crop attributes and their growth conditions. Using classification techniques, it learns patterns to provide accurate recommendations. This system aims to assist farmers and agricultural experts in optimizing crop selection for better yield and sustainability.
